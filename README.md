## Jake Files
This is a collection of tasks executed with the Jake task runner. See http://jakejs.com/

### Prerequisites
1. aws-cli installed and configured
2. docker installed
3. Correct node installed (`cat .nvmrc`, then use `nvm` to install/use that version)

### Quick Start
1. `npm i -g jake`
2. Clone this repo
3. `cd` to jakefiles
4. `npm i`
5. copy the `example.env` to `.env` and add appropriate values. Note: Paths must be absolute and
may not use `~`. Example: `/Users/USERNAME/PATHTOREPO`
6. `jake -T`

### Create a Temporary Ephemeral Environment with Seed Data
All ephemeral environment tasks can be found in the `eph-ephemeral` container in ECS in AWS.
See [this Confluence document](https://greenchef.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GCE/pages/467533859/Ephemeral+Environments)
for more details about ephemeral environments.

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the jakefiles repo and run a deployment command in the following format:
    ```bash
    Template: 
    jake eph:create['STACK']
    
    Example:
    jake eph:create['coffee']
    ```
   - STACK will be used to name all the infrastructure elements that will be created for the environment (ex. task
   names like `eph-coffee-console`, subdomains like `https://eph-coffee-console.greenchef.com/`, pipelines like
   `coffee-console`, etc.); must be alphanumeric and between 1 and 6 characters long.
2. Once this process is complete, deploy code to the new environment using one or both of the pipeline deployment
methods below

### Deploy a Branch to Staging, Production, or an Ephemeral Environment using GitHub and the Deployment Pipeline
See [this Confluence document](https://greenchef.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GCE/pages/167051304/Deployments+with+Jake+and+Codepipeline)
for more details about the pipeline.

1. Make sure the branch you want to deploy is fully up to date on GitHub. This method deploys directly from GitHub.
2. In a terminal window, navigate to the jakefiles repo and run a deployment command in the following format:
    ```bash
    Template: 
    jake pipeline:deploy['ENVIRONMENT','CLUSTER/STACK','REPO','BRANCH']
    
    Example:
    jake pipeline:deploy['stag','one','app-greenchef','my-branch']
    OR
    jake pipeline:deploy['eph','coffee','app-greenchef','my-branch']
    ```
   - ENVIRONMENT is either stag (staging), prod (production), or eph (ephemeral)
   - CLUSTER names for stag/prod environments can be found in AWS in ECS Clusters; STACK is the name that was chosen when an ephemeral environment was created
   - REPO is the name of the repo in GitHub
   - BRANCH is the name of the branch to be deployed
3. Monitor the progress of your deployment in AWS or via #gc-releases in Slack.

### Deploy All Latest Release Branches to a Staging or Ephemeral Environment using Deployment Pipeline
For a staging environment:
```bash
Template: 
jake pipeline:refresh['CLUSTER']

Example:
jake pipeline:refresh['one']
```
For an ephemeral environment:
```bash
Template: 
jake pipeline:refresh['eph','STACK']

Example:
jake pipeline:refresh['eph','coffee']
```

### ZSH Users Special Syntax
According to the [official documentation](http://jakejs.com/docs), ZSH users may need to do one of two things to run `jake` commands:
- Escape brackets or wrap them in single quotes and omit inner quotes: `jake 'deploy:app[stag,uat,console]'`

-- OR --

- Permanently deactivate file-globbing for the `jake` command by adding this line to your `.zshrc` file: `alias jake="noglob jake"`

----------------------------
## DEPRECATED
Everything in this section is **deprecated** functionality.  Use the pipeline methods above whenever possible.

> ### Deploy to Staging or Production from a Local Branch
> Make sure your .env file is up to date
(Example: `PATH_TO_CONSOLE=/Users/bgreene/GreenChef/console-web/`)

> 1. Navigate to the folder you want to deploy. (Example: `greenchef/services/server-greenchef`)
> 2. Check out the branch you want to deploy. (Example: `release/2018-12-04`)
> 3. View the `apps` constant in the `deploy.jake` file in `jakelib` to find the correct name of the docker image you want to push to
(Example: `greenchef/services/server-greenchef` can be deployed to `console-api`, `web-api`, `worker`, or `scheduler`)
> 4. In a separate terminal tab, open the jakefiles repo, and run the deployment command (Example Below)

> #### Example Deployment Command
> Deploy the "console" app to the "stag-uat" ECS cluster.
> (Staging and Production cluster names can be found on AWS in ECS Clusters)
> ```bash
> jake deploy:app['stag','uat','console']
> ```

> ### Deploying Groups of Services with One Command

> #### Core
> Instead of deploying `console-api`, `web-api`, `worker`, and `scheduler` individually, you can instead use the following
with the desired cluster name:
> ```bash
> jake deploy:core['stag','uat']
> ```
> When using this command, note that `scheduler` will be excluded automatically from deployments to clusters with
'stag' in their names. However, if `scheduler` is needed in a staging environment, it can be released individually
using the `deploy:app` syntax in the previous example.

> #### Shipping
> To deploy all shipping services, you can use the following with the desired cluster name:
> ```bash
> jake deploy:shipping['stag','uat']
> ```
