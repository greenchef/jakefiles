#### ZSH Users Special Syntax
According to the [official documentation](http://jakejs.com/docs), ZSH users may need to do one of two things to run `jake` commands:
- Escape brackets or wrap them in single quotes and omit inner quotes: `jake 'deploy:app[staging-uat,console]'`

-- OR --

- Permanently deactivate file-globbing for the `jake` command by adding this line to your `.zshrc` file: `alias jake="noglob jake"`
